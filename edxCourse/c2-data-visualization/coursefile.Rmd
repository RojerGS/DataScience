This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- We start by exploring probability distributions -->
## Probability Distributions
We will start by computing the mean and sd of the male heights and check if it can be approximated by a normal distribution.
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(heights);
idx = heights$sex == "Male";
m = mean(heights$height[idx]);
std_dev = sd(heights$height[idx]);
# compute standard units
z = scale(heights$height[idx]);
# around 95% of measurements should be within 2 std deviations from the mean
sum(abs(z) < 2) / length(z)
p = seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05)
quantiles <- quantile(heights$height[idx], p);
actual_quantiles <- qnorm(p, mean=m, sd=std_dev)
plot(quantiles, actual_quantiles)
abline(0,1)
```
Or we could use the standard units instead,
```{r}
quantiles <- quantile(z, p);
actual_quantiles <- qnorm(p)
plot(quantiles, actual_quantiles)
abline(0,1)
```

Now we will describe the female heights, supposedly following a normal distribution as well. Start with a Q-Q plot
```{r}
hs <- heights$height[heights$sex == "Female"];
z <- scale(hs);
quantiles <- quantile(z, p);
actual_quantiles <- qnorm(p);
plot(quantiles, actual_quantiles);
abline(0, 1)
```

Now we pause our work on distributions to learn some things about ggplot2. We load it with ggplot2 or with tidyverse and load the murders dataset to create a nifty graph later:

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
```

Start by creating the object and assigning its data; notice it is completely blank, even though it has data associated with it.

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data = murders)
plot
```

Add a "layer" (a component) which specifies we will use a scatter plot. That geometry is defined by geom_point

```{r}
plot <- plot + geom_point(aes(x = population/10^6, y = total))
plot
```

And then we add a layer with the US state names.

```{r}
plot <- plot + geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label=abb))
plot
```

Tinker with some parameters a bit to make the plot nicer

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data=murders) +
        geom_point(aes(population/10^6, total), size=3) +
        geom_text(aes(population/10^6, total, label=abb), nudge_x = 1)
plot
```

Or redefine the whole plot with a global mapping, so we don't have to keep mapping population to totals every single time...
Also notice how we can introduce layers that ignore the global mappings and just use the local ones.

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data=murders, mapping=aes(population/10^6, total, label=abb)) +
        geom_text(nudge_x = 1) +
        geom_point(size = 3);
plot <- plot + geom_text(aes(x=10, y=50, label="wowowow"))
plot
```

change the scales of the axes
```{r}
plot <- plot + 
        scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
        scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")
plot
```

because of the log scale we need to compensate the nudge :P

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data=murders, mapping=aes(population/10^6, total, label=abb)) +
        geom_text(nudge_x = 0.075) +
        geom_point(size = 3) +
        scale_x_log10() +
        scale_y_log10();
plot
```

and now add labels and a title, as well as colour; assign a categorical variable so it gives different colours to different categories.

```{r}
plot <- plot +
        xlab("Population in millions (log scale)") +
        ylab("Total murders (log scale)") +
        ggtitle("Gun murders in USA") +
        geom_point(aes(col=region), size=3)
plot
```

Now find the US avg murder rate so we can plot a helper line.
```{r}
rate <- murders %>%
          summarize(rate = sum(total)/sum(population)*10^6) %>% .$rate
plot <- plot + geom_abline(intercept=log10(rate))
plot
```

Change line colour, style, and make it before the points.
```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data=murders, mapping=aes(population/10^6, total, label=abb)) +
        geom_text(nudge_x = 0.075) +
        geom_point(size = 3) +
        scale_x_log10() +
        scale_y_log10() +
        xlab("Population in millions (log scale)") +
        ylab("Total murders (log scale)") +
        ggtitle("Gun murders in USA") +
        geom_abline(intercept = log10(rate), lty=2, color="darkgrey") +
        geom_point(aes(col=region), size=3) +
        scale_color_discrete(name="Region")
plot
```

Last finishing touches with add-ons
```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data=murders, mapping=aes(population/10^6, total, label=abb)) +
        geom_point(size = 3) +
        scale_x_log10() +
        scale_y_log10() +
        xlab("Population in millions (log scale)") +
        ylab("Total murders (log scale)") +
        ggtitle("Gun murders in USA") +
        geom_abline(intercept = log10(rate), lty=2, color="darkgrey") +
        geom_point(aes(col=region), size=3) +
        scale_color_discrete(name="Region") +
        theme_economist() + geom_text_repel()
plot
```

Now make the histogram for the male heights
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
malehs <- heights %>% filter(sex=="Male")
plot <- malehs %>% ggplot(aes(x=height)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth=1, fill="blue", col="black") +
        ggtitle("Histogram of male heights") +
        xlab("Male heights")
plot
```

and the smooth densities and the qq plots
```{r}
baseplot <- malehs %>% ggplot(aes(x=height))
density <- baseplot + geom_density(fill="blue")
# prepare the parameters
params = heights %>% filter(sex=="Male") %>% summarize(mean=mean(height), sd=sd(height))
qq <- heights %>% ggplot(aes(sample=height)) + geom_qq(dparams = params) + geom_abline()
density
qq
```

Now we also make two smooth density plots for male and female students by grouping their data.
```{r}
heights %>% ggplot(aes(height, group=sex)) + geom_density()
```

instead we can request two different colours and two density plots are drawn automagically; we can also fill them!
```{r}
heights %>% ggplot(aes(height, color=sex)) + geom_density()
heights %>% ggplot(aes(height, fill=sex)) + geom_density(alpha=0.2)
```

## Random dplyr magic

Now, for section 3 of the course, we will fiddle around with a bit of dplyr.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(heights)
data(murders)
```

Start with some standard summarizing
```{r}
s <- heights %>%
      filter(sex == "Male") %>%
      summarize(avg = mean(height), stdev = sd(height))
s$avg
```

also note how to make dplyr return vectors instead of data frames:
```{r}
s1 <- murders %>% summarize(rate = sum(total)/sum(population))
s1
class(s1)
s2 <- murders %>% summarize(rate = sum(total)/sum(population)) %>% .$rate
s2
class(s2)
```

Now we group things with group_by and then summarize
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(avg = mean(height), stdev = sd(height))
murders %>% group_by(region) %>% summarize(rate = sum(total)/sum(population)*100000)
```

Order data frames by a specific column
```{r}
murders %>% arrange(population) %>% head()
murders %>% arrange(desc(population)) %>% head()
murders %>% arrange(region, desc(population))
```

Explore a random data set for the DataCamp exercise. Study a bit the blood pressure of female patients ages 20-29.
```{r}
library(NHANES)
data(NHANES)
tab <- NHANES %>% filter(Gender == "female" & AgeDecade == " 20-29")
ref <- tab %>% summarize(avg = mean(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE), stdev = sd(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE))
ref_avg <- ref %>% .$avg
```
And now do it for all female patients, grouped by age:
```{r}
NHANES %>% filter(Gender == "female") %>%
            group_by(AgeDecade) %>%
            summarize(avg = mean(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE), stdev = sd(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Study the avg systolic blood pressure by race (Race1 variable):
```{r}
NHANES %>% filter(Gender=="male" & AgeDecade==" 40-49") %>%
    group_by(Race1) %>%
    summarize(average=mean(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE), standard_deviation=sd(BPSysAve, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
    arrange(average)
```
